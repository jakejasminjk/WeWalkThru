        <h4>InterChristian Small Groups</h4>
        <p>InterChristian Groups meet once a week and InterChristian Fellowship meets once a month. In the early church the believers came together, fellowship together and study together. But now is the time again come for us to come together.</p>
        <p>InterChristian International is Initiating Small Group Stratergy region wise, so that people from different worshipping community could join and be strenghtened in their walk of faith.</p>
        <p>We foresee this small group to become a supporting group for the members. It will maintain the trust and confidentiality but support in the members emotional and spiritual wellness. The support group could become a sponsoring group to sponsor some good cuase. There is a need to send workers to the unreached places around the World. The small group could grow to become one of such group that sponsored and several missionaries from west to eact and elsewhere.</p>
