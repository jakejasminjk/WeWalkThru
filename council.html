        <p>"That all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me".  John 17:21</p>
        <p>"Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments; As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore". Psalms 133:1-3.</p>
        <p>The founder of the Mission InterChristian Initiatives envisions that InterChristian Society will empower the Christian Church particularly the non affiliate Churches and to link them with World Council of Churches and United Nations.  As per these prayer of Lord Jesus Christ "That all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. So the part of the vision is to create InterChristian Council  of Churches.  While these churches will be independent they will have an umbrella called InterChristian Council of Churches.</p>
        <p>InterChristian Council is an International Umbrella Body of Bible Believing Churches based in Princeton, New Jersey in United States particularly of those Churches which do not have an affiliation with any other International Body such as Anglican Communion or World Council of Churches. InterChristian Council offer national and international level fellowship and partnership among its like-minded member Churches and Missions of 21st century. While the mainline traditional Churches are struggling with its own challenges to survive, God is raising visionaries and ministers independently to accomplish His Mission in the place of His calling locally and globally. It is the need of the hour for such pastors and ministers gets their deserved identity and influence.</p>
