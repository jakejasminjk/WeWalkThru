        <p>The founder and the CEO of the mission lost his Mother at the age of seven and depended on his relatives and church community for all his basic needs including his educational needs. He studied in government public school and in Seminary on scholarship. During his Christian ministry of 30 years, he visited several villages and sensed a strong need to raise support for the Kids living without basic needs. Now that he has established InterChristian International, he envisions to help build as many schools as possible in India through responsive agencies that are working at the grassroots level with a viable structure to implement holistic development program. We undertake to support the Educational Building Projects in Asian and African countries in next five years.</p>
        <p>We invite generous donors to support this project. Ninety percent of the funds raised is sent to the building projects and directly spent to build the facilities. If you are interested in supporting this project, please contact the office of InterChristian Initiatives with their toll free number. This school will have no other way to raise this support as it is in asbestos building for the last 20 years.  Your support will elevate the School children from their poverty and give them a gift of life with all these basic needs met.</p>
        <p>The school building you see above is CSI T.D.T.A.Elementary School run by Tirunelveli Diocesan Trust Association's Rayagiri Christ CSI Church at 13 Ghandhi Street, Rayagiri Village, Tirunelveli Diocese, India. The CEO of our mission personally visited this school building and promised to replace the asbestos sheet roof with concrete roof of two floor building. An Indian Community Church called Christ Church of South India worshiping at 32 Old Tappan Road, Tappan, New York 10983 support to build the School up and till the stage in which you see the building below.</p>
        <p>Rev Paul Rajan says in his own words "I visited a rural school in Rayagiri Village Tamil nadu India during 2013 in which one of our family friend is working as a Teacher. There were about 100 children studying from first grade to 5th grade as it was an elementary school managed by a church that you see in the picture. Teachers pay is paid by government aid but the church does not have funds to replace the asbestos sheet of the building. It pained me to see the children sitting in 104 degree heat under asbestos sheet for 5 years. I used to study in a school of that kind in a near by village but now I live in USA. So when I came back to USA I presented the matter to Tappan Christ CSI Church and the committee and congregation together did a concert to raise funds and we sent that money to Rayagiri School Building. What you see is the accomplishment. But we need more funds to complete it before the first week of June 2016 as the next acadamic year will begin. It is a genuine cause and i feel bad that I am unable to complete it. So I like to put this appeal out to the kind hearted to generously donate so that the children will be in the RCC roof building from June 2016. I am grateful to everyone who helped so far from the Church and who will help to complete the school building. My prayers is that May the good Lord return to you in manyfold as you show the  seed in the lives of the poor children. God bless you".</p>
        <p>The School is an accredited Elementary School started in the Year 1940 and presently has 62 Children. The total size of the building is 510 Sqft (27.5ftx18.5ft). Once when the two floor is completed it will have 5 class rooms for 1 - 5 Grade classes.
