        <p>InterChristian Fellowship</p>
        <p>"For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them." Matthew 18:20
            "My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me". John 17:20 - 21.
            "How good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity!". Psalm 133.1</p>
        <p>As per these words of Jewish Scripture and Lord Jesus Christ the need for unity is very urgent and can not be ignored. People are divided in many ways and Christians are divided in many mindsets.  But the great commission is given for everybody to love and serve the people. Therefore, The InterChristian International has initiated several educational initiatives in order to teach life based, application based and skills based program in the Churches. And the end result of teaching is to start non denominational christian fellowship but not a church. This will help the Christians to come together for the purpose of fellowship and relationship.</p>
        <p>We would like to meet you if you will be interested in conducting a monthly non denominational fellowship in your area.</p>
        <p>Please write an email to our office@interchristian.org to know more about this need and various other projects.</p>
        <h1 class = "body footer">It requires only two or three people to start a monthly InterChristian Fellowship in your zip code or in your area. Please contact us for help and guidance.</h1>
