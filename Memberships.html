        <h3>InterChristian Society</h3>
        <p>"That all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me".  John 17:21</p>
        <p>As per these prayer of Lord Jesus Christ "That all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me" this initiative is taken up to coordinate the missional activities of the believers community. Again His words "harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few" is true in those days and even today. But if we compare the population then and now, today's population is thousands of times more. There are certainly not enough laborers. Moreover, the great commission is given for everybody to love and serve the people. Therefore, The InterChristian International has initiated several educational initiatives in order to teach life based, application based and skills based program.</p>
        <p>We organize several programs that will bring the believers community to realize that we need to be united in serving the world in need of peace, love, joy and salvation. These programs are aimed at wellbeing and vitality of the spiritual community.</p>
        <h3>Empowerment of Small Groups to become a powerful Society</h3>
        <p>InterChristian International is organizing small groups to function as self-help group and moves on to organize Council, Association, Consortium, Federation, Alliance and Society as per the need of the community that we work with. We invite you to stay in touch with us to work together on building network among your community of congregants and professionals.</p>
        <p>We would like to meet you if you will be interested in conducting a monthly non denominational fellowship or weekly small group in your homes. The society could become stronger with many small groups.</p>
