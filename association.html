        <h3>InterChristian Association for Ministry Professionals</h3>
        <em>An International Association for Pastors, Ministers, Counselors, Missionaries, Chaplain, Leaders and Theologians, empowered in Unity to fulfill the Great Commission</em>
        <p> "That all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me".  John 17:21</p>
        <p>"Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;  As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore". Psalms 133:1-3.</p>
        <p>The founder of the Mission InterChristian Initiatives envisions that InterChristian Society will empower the Christian Ministers, Pastors, Missionaries and Priests.  As per these prayer of Lord Jesus Christ "That all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. So the part of the vision is to create an Association to identify and unit these Christian full time men and women of God who are working full time at least once a year to fulfill the calling. The fellowship will help them to share the burden with one another and bear the burden. A supporting community around them will help these people of God to ease their loads and continue not only to persevere but also thrive in their own ministries. </p>
