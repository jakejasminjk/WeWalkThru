        <p>"Therefore said he unto them, the harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest".  Luke 10:2</p>
        <p>As per these words of Lord Jesus Christ the harvest is plentiful in those days and even today, the laborers are few in those days and even today. But if we compare the population then and now, todays population is thousands of times more. There are certainly not enough laborers. Moreover, the great commission is given for everybody to love and serve the people. Therefore, The InterChristian International has initiated several educational initiatives in order to teach life based, application based and skills based program in the Churches.</p>
        <p>Topics on InterChristian Seminars include in the category of Contemporary Issues, Christian Leadership, Community Leadership, Multi-Cultural Communication, Christian Life, Management, Marriage, Relationship, Seminar on various ministries in the Churches and Pastoral Skills based courses.</p>
        <p>These Seminars are organized interdenominationally and nondenominationally. The Seminar could be organized from for either three days or three hours. It could also be organized for either seven hours or seven days. Though there is no fee involved for the seminar we do encourage every participant and the organizing body to contribute towards the self-supporting efforts and growth of the mission.</p>
        <p>The founder of the mission is a clinical pastoral educator and involved in various teaching aspects of the ministries for the past thirty years. Once we receive a request to run a seminar in your group or church we would identify an expert in the field of your request and depute to run the course in your vicinity. Please contact the office of the InterChristian International.</p>
        <p>Please write an email to our office@interchristian.org to know the schedule for the upcoming Seminars</p>
