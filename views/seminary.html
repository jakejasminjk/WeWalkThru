        <p>"Therefore said he unto them, the harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest". Luke 10:2
        </p>
        
        <p>As per these words of Lord Jesus Christ the harvest is plentiful in those days and even today, the laborers are few in those days and even today. But if we compare the population then and now, todays population is thousands of times more. There are certainly not enough laborers. Moreover, the great commission is given for everybody to love and serve the people. Therefore, The InterChristian International has initiated several educational initiatives in order to teach life based, application based and skills based program in the Churches.

        <p>InterChristian Seminary is one of the big plan of InterChristian Initiatives to train full time Pastors, Missionaries, Counsellors, Pastoral Clinicians and Pastoral Educators at an affordable student loans and scholarships. According to the dictionary meaning the word seminary is a school, especially one where people train to be religious leaders.

According to the longings of Jesus Christ there has to be more laborers needed to be breeded.
