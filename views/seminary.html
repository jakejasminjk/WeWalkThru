But if we compare the population then and now, todays population is thousands of times more. There are certainly not enough laborers. Moreover, the great commission is given for everybody to love and serve the people. Therefore, The InterChristian International has initiated several educational initiatives in order to teach life based, application based and skills based program in the Churches.</p>

According to the longings of Jesus Christ there has to be more laborers needed to be breeded. </p>
