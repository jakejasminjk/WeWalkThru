        <h3>OUR POLICIES,YOUR PRIVACY AND TERMS</h3>
        <p>InterChristian Initiatives International is a registered charity based in Princeton, New Jersey serving the world.  At the InterChristian Initiatives Incorporated International (“INTERCHRISTIAN“), we are committed to maintaining the accuracy, confidentiality and security of your personal information. INTERCHRISTIAN has adopted a series of Privacy Policies in order to address the specific privacy concerns of certain groupings of individuals. This Privacy Policy applies to how we collect, use and disclose the personal information of those individuals who visit our website and interact with us via mobile device. We will determine whether our other policies apply to you, based on the nature of your relationship with INTERCHRISTIAN, and will provide a copy of any relevant privacy policies.</p>
        
        <!-- PRIVACY POLICY EFFECTIVE FOR US -->
        <p>PRIVACY POLICY EFFECTIVE FOR UNITED STATES<br>
        It is INTERCHRISTIAN’s policy to comply with applicable privacy legislation. Sometimes the privacy legislation and/or an individual’s right to privacy are different from one jurisdiction to another. This Privacy Policy covers only those activities that are subject to the provisions of United States of America federal and state laws, as applicable. Consequently, the rights and obligations contained in this Privacy Policy may not be available to all individuals or in all jurisdictions. Where we share your personal information with one of our ministry partners in other countries, that partner will be responsible for your personal information and their use of your personal information will be subject to the applicable laws in that country.
        </p>
        
        <!-- personal info -->

        <!-- Children Privacy -->
        
        <p>CHILDREN’S ONLINE PRIVACY<br> We are concerned about the privacy of young children, and we do not collect any more personal information than is reasonably necessary to enable them to participate in the activities we offer on our sites.

        <!-- COOKIES -->
        <p>HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?<br> When you visit our website, we may place a “cookie” on your computer to track your visit. A cookie is a small data file that can only be read by the website that placed the cookie on your hard drive. The cookie acts as an identification card and allows our website to identify you and to retain information that is relevant to interacting with our website. The cookie allows us to track your visit to the website so that we can better understand your use of our website and customize it to better meet your needs. We may use different types of cookies on our website: persistent cookies; session cookies; and third-party cookies. (Please refer to your browser’s Help section for further information on controlling and setting cookies).</p>
        
        <p>A persistent cookie remains on your computer for authentication purposes where the use of this website requires a username and password. We may use a persistent cookie to save your username, with your consent given on your computer, so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit one of our sites. You may choose to reject persistent cookies and use your login password each time you visit a site, and the site will still function correctly.</p>
        
        <p>A session cookie is temporary, only used during a single session on this website, and is automatically deleted at the end of your visit. We may use session cookies (a) to customize your visit to this website and your online experience, (b) to deliver content consistent with your stated interests and the manner in which you browse and/or use this website, and (c) for other purposes to make your visit more convenient.</p>
        
        <p>You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or flush them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Depending on the website, the rejection of session cookies may interfere with the functionality of this website and in certain cases you may have to accept session cookies in order for the site to function at all. If your browser does not differentiate between persistent and session cookies, you may have to enable all cookies in order for this website to function properly.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to cookies, we may use web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of websites. These may be used to send information directly to us, to another party on our behalf, or to another party in accordance with its privacy policy. We may use web beacons to bring together information we collect about you.</p>
        
        <!-- ADVERTISING -->
        <p>WHAT ABOUT ONLINE ADVERTISING?<br> We promote and encourage support of our ministry activities and resources by purchasing advertising space on third-party websites. When you visit some websites, we or a third party may place one or more types of cookies on your computer in order to recognize your computer. Because we advertise about our ministry activities on third-party websites, we are able to compile anonymous information over time about the types of pages, content, and ads you or others who use your computer visited or viewed. This anonymous information is used for many purposes. For example, it helps us try to ensure that you do not see the same advertisements repeatedly. We also use this anonymous information to help select and display targeted advertisements on third-party websites that encourage support of our ministry activities.</p>
        
        <p>Third-party companies also may collect anonymous information about your activity on our websites and applications and on third-party websites and applications using online tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons. Tracking data collected by these third-party companies is used to decide which advertisements you see on third-party websites and applications, but does not identify you personally. You may choose not to receive targeted advertisements from many ad networks, data exchanges, marketing analytics and other service providers by visiting the Ad Preferences Manager.</p>
        
        <p>WHAT ABOUT LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES?<br> Our website may contain links to other websites. To allow you to interact with third-party websites on which you may have accounts (such as social media websites) or join communities on such websites, we may provide links or embed third-party applications that allow you to login, post content, or join communities from our websites.

        <p>DISCLOSURE<br> We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.
        </p>
        
        <p>PAYMENT<br> If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase/donation, then Shopify Organizations your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase/donation transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction.

        <p>All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.

        <p>THIRD-PARTY SERVICES<br> In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us. However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions. For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.</p>
        
        <p>In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.</p>
        
        <p>As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act. Once you leave our Organization’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.</p>
