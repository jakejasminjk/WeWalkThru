        <p class = "body">As per these prayer of Lord Jesus Christ "That all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me" this initiative is taken up to coordinate the missional activities of the believers community. Again His words "harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few" is true in those days and even today. But if we compare the population then and now, today's population is thousands of times more. There are certainly not enough laborers. Moreover, the great commission is given for everybody to love and serve the people. Therefore, The InterChristian International has initiated several educational initiatives in order to teach life based, application based and skills based program.</p>
        <p class = "body">We organize several programs that will bring the believers community to realize that we need to be united in serving the world in need of peace, love, joy and salvation. These programs are aimed at wellbeing and vitality of the spiritual community.</p>
        <h5 class = "center">Empowerment of Small Groups to become a powerful Society</h5>
