            <p>Our mission InterChristian International was initiated upon the inspiration received from the Lord Jesus Christ by the CEO and Visionary The Rev. Dr. Paul G. Rajan. The vision is to to make united efforts and involve everyone in a meaningful way to be an agent of change and peace in the community. Philosophy and doctrine divides us in our understanding of God and spirituality. But God calls every one to serve others in need. Service will unite together. The growing number of empty pews in the churches is the sign that we are not doing what we are called to do. Severe intolerance among each other divides the people of God in a significant way and prevents them from being an effective witness for the love of God, an authentic agent of change and blessing to others.</p>

            <p class = "text1">The founder and CEO The Rev. Paul Rajan initiated this international movement InterChristian Initiatives in Princeton, New Jersey, USA  on November 11, 2013 in continuation to his first organization Christian Life Service which was originally started in India on the bicentinery celebration of the great missionary William Carey that was on November 11, 1993. His vision of bringing the believers together for the cause of fulfilling great commission is the reason behind this mission. We earnestly pray that you and your believers group will catch this vision and become part of this worldwide movement to win the lost for Christ. So that there be joy in heaven. We are looking for you and your Church to join INTERCHRISTIAN DREAM TEAM and be part of this worldwide movement of united efforts by your valuable Prayers, Participation and Partnership. You could volunteer from wherever you are, with whatever you have and do whatever you can. Joining with the Dream Team will add to your strength. Your time, energy, efforts, expertise to the cause of this united mission will enhance and speed up the work and fulfill the great commission. We have hundreds of projects that you could become part of as per the talents and gifts you have been blessed with. Please write to the visionary leader by email <strong>ceo@interchristian.org</strong></p>
